_PRIORITY CRITICAL_
- [ ] Review why I cannot access "explore" link (events) on the production test: same for marketplace

_PRIORITY MAJOR_
- [ ] To avoid repeated requests for same state, possible solution: Hash images?
- [ ] ? waitForNetworkIdle add timeout with error handling -> First test what happens if timeout is reached, does it affect to other rooms?
- [ ] Allow to navigate history forward/back Â¿ keys 1 & 2 ?
- [ ] Add scroll bar
- [ ] Refactor into a component


_PRIORITY MEDIUM_
- [ ] Try to inject script to show effect on clicks when DOMElement (a,button,etc.) with mouse listener is clicked
- [ ] Improve infinite scroll handling
- [ ] Add sound effects 
- [ ] Review if to control locked use server side
- [ ] Add a logs / monitoring page or modify the one from colyseus/fork
- [ ] Rust server using rust-headless-chrome

_COMPLETED_
- [x] Add spinner loading
- [x] Add top status bar with room.state.url (black/white text)
- [x] Add bottom status bar with other room state data (back/white text)
- [x] For now to avoid infinite scroll issue, set a maximum scroll screenshots

- [x] REVIEW: What happens if after a click, fullHeight changes?
- [x] REVIEW: After making click on marketplace from governance, I still see an api call to
    governance screenshot
- [x] Do screenshots at intervals? add date to screenshots?
- [x] Detect when a link opens a new tab -> openExternalLink
- [x] Lock use for user for 30 seconds ? -> Say in satus bar who is using with a timer
- [x] Implement colyseus reconnection
- [x] -> Or better, make it automatic interval -> Add a reconnect/restart button (for when something fails in server, etc.)
- [x] Prepare a production deployment so people can test it
